## Declare-String-Variables

Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

```js
var myName;
```

But you can also declare a string variable like this:

```js
var myName = 'your name';
```

`"your name"` is called a <dfn>string</dfn> <dfn>literal</dfn>. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

_Task:_ Create two new string variables: `myFirstName` and `myLastName` and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
